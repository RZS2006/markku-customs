# Markku Customs

This is the official website of Markku Customs, a company founded by Markku Kauppinen. This website's main job is to function as a descriptive shop website. 

The website does not include a purchasing system (avoiding the need for customer data collection (cookies)). Instead, you are going to have to contact Markku Kauppinen and discuss what type of PC you want built. The website showcases different PC pricepoints and what you can expect from them performance-wise. This approach to web stores allows for unlimited customizability, flexibility, and a simple way to offer recommendations, since some component combos don't make any sense (e.g. custom loop for a 65w tdp cpu...). This project is not a large scale thing yet but if things ramp up we might need to add more functionality to this design.
