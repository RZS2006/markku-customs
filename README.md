# Maggu-Project

This is a SPA website made for Markku Kauppinen and his company MK Customs. This websites' main job is to function as a descriptive shop website. The website does not include a purchasing system (avoiding the need for customer data collection (cookies))  instead you are going to have to contact Markku Kauppinen and discuss what type of PC you want built. The website showcases different PC pricepoints and what you can expect from them performance wise. this approach to webstores allows for unlimited customizability, flexibility and a simple way to offer recommendations since some component combos don't make any sense (custom loop for a 65w tdp cpu...). this project is not a large scale thing yet but if things ramp up we might need to add more functionality to this design.
